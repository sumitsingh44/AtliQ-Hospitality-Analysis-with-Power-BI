- Show distribution within platforms, such as the "Logtrip", "Journey", "Direct Booking" and many more.

##### Table:

- Display detailed numerical data for "Hospitality" analysis, including Revenue, ADR, DURN. DBRN. Occupancy % and many more.


## Functions Applied: 

- CALCULATE: Modify the filter context of a calculation.
- SUM: Aggregate numerical values for total calculations.
- SUMX: Iterate over a table and sum the results.
- FILTER: Filter data based on specific conditions.
- RELATED: Retrieve related data from another table.
- IF: Perform conditional logic.
- DIVIDE: Perform division with error handling for division by zero.
- DATEADD: Add or subtract a specified number of days, months, quarters, or years from a date.
- DISTINCTCOUNT: Count the number of distinct values.
- AVERAGE: Calculate the average of numerical values.
